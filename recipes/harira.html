    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Harira is a traditional Moroccan soup that is both hearty and flavorful, 
        often enjoyed during Ramadan to break the fast. It’s made with a rich tomato base, 
        tender lentils, chickpeas, and a mix of warming spices like cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric. 
        The addition of fresh herbs, such as cilantro and parsley, gives it a vibrant taste, while thin noodles or 
        rice add a satisfying texture.</p>

    <p>Loved for its comforting qualities, Harira is versatile and can include lamb, chicken, or be 
        made vegetarian. Typically served with dates, hard-boiled eggs, or bread, it embodies the 
        warmth of Moroccan hospitality. This nourishing soup is not only a meal in itself but also a symbol of 
        togetherness and tradition.</p>
